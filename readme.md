Generates a linear mxn array code over a term rank metric space with the magmacode.txt

Run this Magma file locally

magmacode creates an output file which will be read by the python script

Compute the minimum term rank distance of the resulting code running mxnMTR.py file (Python 2.7)

Don't forget to set the values for m,n in the python code and give an appropriate output file name in magmacode,
so edit both first in sublime to set these variables.
